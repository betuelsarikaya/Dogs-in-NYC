# Lede Project - Dogs in NYC
### This is my first project for LEDE 2025

The goal of this project is to explore the world of dogs in New York City. Specifically, I wanted to find out how many dogs live in the city, which breeds are popular in which neighborhoods, and what the most common dog names are.

### Data Source

The data for this project comes from **NYC Open Data** and can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp/about_data).
